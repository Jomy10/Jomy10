- Currently working on 't Voetje, an app for [KSA Noordzeegouw](https://www.ksa.be/werkkringen/ksa-noordzeegouw)
  - Related to that I have the [Voetje Encoding Engine](https://github.com/Jomy10/voetje_encoding_engine) project, for which I'm looking for contributors.
- Currently learning [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)

<!--TODO: 
Have a server running a function every week or so.
